# Philo App

## Introduction

Welcome!

We're glad you found Philo, a reading list app for philosophy book lovers.  The app is even better for those curious about philosophy and want to keep track of some popular books and authors to check out.

Philo is a Command Line CRUD App that accesses a Sqlite3 Database using ActiveRecord. Our three models are "User", "Book", and "User Book Choices" and their relationships are as follows:

1. "Book" has many "User Book Choices" AND has many "User" through "User Book Choices".
2. "User" has many "User Book Choices" AND has many "Book" through "User Book Choices".
3. "User Book Choices" belongs to "User" AND "Book"

"Book" and "User" are considered the parents because they are the models that "has many", while "User Book Choices" is considered the child because it is the model that "belongs to".  Through these relationships we have built out a CLI to give our user full CRUD ability. Some features a user can enjoy are creating a book list, reading their book choices, updating their book choices, deleting a book choice, and searching google for a book choice to add to their list. This 'search google' functionality allows the user to add books to their list that aren't already in the database. Under the hood, all of our commands are executed in our run.rb and run_commands.rb files.
